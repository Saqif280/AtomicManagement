## Introduction
Thank you for participating in user testing for our new additions to the Atom Text Editor. Today, you will be presented with a variety of tasks using our new package and the Atom Text Editor. The focus of this code will be on the program itself, not on you as a user.

This test will take approximately 30 minutes, and you may opt out of this testing at any time. All personal data will be kept confidential, reviewed only the development team and the CS 5150 course staff.  The results of your test will be written up in a report with all personally identifiable data removed.

Over the course of the test, the development team will be recording your own screen interaction using screen capture. Moreover, the development team will be personally observing and noting your interaction with our program. Again, the focus of our notes will be on testing the program, not you as the user.

You will be presented with a guide on how to work with our package, but this will be the only guidance the development team will give you regarding the user testing. If you are truly stuck on a particular aspect, you may skip it; however, the development team will not be able to answer any questions you have while the test is being conducted. At the end of the test, the conductors of the survey will ask you some questions regarding your experience with out package.

If you have any questions regarding the use of the results of the user testing, feel free to contact the development team liaison, Daniel Hirsch, at djh329@cornell.edu. We thank you for your participation

## Task 1
Using the Atom text editor, open the file `test1.md` in the folder `UserTesting` in `Documents`. Your goal is to open the file with the following configuration:
* Text color is red,
* The markdown live preview is enabled
* Tab spacing is set to 2 spaces
Your goal is to do this without manually changing any of these properties.
We will give you the following advice: In order for a configuration styling to take affect, atom must be opened with a project that contains a `.atomproject` file, not just opening the file itself.
When you are sure these settings are present, please signal the member of the development team administering this test.


## Task 2
Using the Atom text editor, open the file `test2.md` in the folder `Test2` in the folder `UserTesting` in `Documents`. Your goal is to open the file with the following configuration:
* Text color is green,
* The markdown live preview is enabled
* Tab spacing is set to 4 spaces
Your goal is to do this without manually changing any of these properties.
We will give you the following advice: In order for a configuration styling to take affect, atom must be opened with a project that contains a `.atomproject` file, not just opening the file itself.
When you are sure these settings are present, please signal the member of the development team administering this test
