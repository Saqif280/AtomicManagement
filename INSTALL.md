# Installation

You must have Atom > 1.26 (get it [here](https://atom.io/beta)) as well as the Atom Package Manager, which should come with Atom.

1. Unzip or clone the repository to any working directory
1. Change your working directory to the root of the package (currently the `/core-rework/` folder)
1. Run `apm link` to link the package to your package directory
1. Run `apm install` to install dependencies
