## Introduction
Thank you for participating in user testing for a new plugin to the Atom Text Editor; Today, you will be presented with a variety of tasks. **The focus of these tasks will be on the plugin itself, not on you as a user**. You are free to quit at any time.

This test will take approximately 30 minutes. All personal data will be kept confidential, reviewed only by the development team and the CS 5150 course staff.  The results of your test will be written up in a report with all personally identifiable data removed.

Over the course of the test, the development team will be recording your own screen interaction using screen capture. Moreover, the development team will be personally observing and noting your interaction with our program. Again, the focus of our notes will be on the program, not you as the user.

You will be presented with a guide on how to work with our package, but this will be the only guidance the development team will give you regarding the user testing. If you are truly stuck on a particular aspect, you may skip it; however, the development team will not be able to answer any questions you have while the test is being conducted. At the end of the test, the conductors of the test will ask you some questions regarding your experience with out package.

If you have any questions regarding the use of the results of the user testing, feel free to contact the development team liaison, Daniel Hirsch, at djh329@cornell.edu. We thank you for your participation.

## Scenario
You are the professor of Cornell's INFO 1111 and you are planning your first project for the semester. In order to ease the grading on your TAs, you decided you will add a configuration file using the new Atomic Management Package.

## Task 1
In order to make all the code uniform and easy to read, you decide it would be best that all students doing the project should have:
* Have all users have tab spacing of length 2
* Enable soft wrap in the text editor
* Affect the white space package to limit the amount of new lines at the end of files to be only one

You also decide that it would be good to:
* Disable the `php-server` Package

Make a configuration file to enforce these ideas.


## Task 2
You want to prove to yourself that these configurations actually work. Make a file and put some code/text in it to show the configurations are actually enforced.
