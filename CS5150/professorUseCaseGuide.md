## Introduction
Thank you for participating in user testing for a new plugin to the Atom Text Editor. Today, you will be presented with a variety of tasks. **The focus of these tasks will be on the plugin itself, not on you as a user**. You are free to quit at any time.

This test will take approximately 30 minutes. All personal data will be kept confidential, reviewed only by the our team and the CS 5150 course staff.  The results of your test will be written up in a report with all personally identifiable data removed.

Over the course of the test, your screen interaction will be recorded using screen capture. Moreover, the administrative team will be personally observing and noting your interaction with the program. Again, the focus of our notes will be on the program, not you as the user.

You will be presented with a [guide](https://github.com/Saqif280/atomic-management#readme) on how to work with this particular package, but this will be the only guidance the you will have regarding the user testing. If you are truly stuck on a particular aspect, you may skip it; however, we will not be able to answer any questions you have while the test is being conducted. At the end of the test, we will ask you some questions regarding your experience with the package. We will also give you a detailed introduction of our package after the test. But for now, please just focus on the tasks below.

If you have any questions regarding the use of the results of the user testing, feel free to contact the development team liaison, Daniel Hirsch, at djh329@cornell.edu. We thank you for your participation.

## Scenario
You are the professor of Cornell's INFO 1111 and you are planning your first project for the semester. You have already finished writing the starter code for this project, saved in the folder `Documents/INFO1111/Project1`. Before releasing `Project1` to the students, you decided you will add a configuration file using the new `atomic-management` Package, in order to ease the grading on your TAs.

## Task 1
Please open `Project1` as project root directory in Atom.

## Task 2
In order to make all the code uniform and easy to read, you decide it would be best that all students doing the project should have:
* Have all users have tab spacing of length 2
* Enable soft wrap in the text editor
* Affect the `Whitespace` package to limit the amount of new lines at the end of files to be only 1

You also decide that it would be good to:
* Disable the `php-server` Package

Make a configuration file to enforce these ideas.

## Task 3
You want to prove to yourself that these configurations actually work. Make a file and put some code/text in it to show the configurations are actually enforced.
