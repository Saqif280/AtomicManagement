## Introduction
Thank you for participating in user testing for a new plugin to the Atom Text Editor; Today, you will be presented with a variety of tasks. **The focus of these tasks will be on the plugin itself, not on you as a user**. You are free to quit at any time.

This test will take approximately 30 minutes. All personal data will be kept confidential, reviewed only by the development team and the CS 5150 course staff.  The results of your test will be written up in a report with all personally identifiable data removed.

Over the course of the test, the development team will be recording your own screen interaction using screen capture. Moreover, the development team will be personally observing and noting your interaction with our program. Again, the focus of our notes will be on the program, not you as the user.

You will be presented with a [guide](https://github.com/Saqif280/atomic-management#readme) on how to work with our package, but this will be the only guidance the development team will give you regarding the user testing. If you are truly stuck on a particular aspect, you may skip it; however, the development team will not be able to answer any questions you have while the test is being conducted. At the end of the test, the conductors of the test will ask you some questions regarding your experience with out package.

If you have any questions regarding the use of the results of the user testing, feel free to contact the development team liaison, Daniel Hirsch, at djh329@cornell.edu. We thank you for your participation.

## User Test
Scenario: You are a student taking INFO 1111, and your professor has just assigned the first coding project.

## Task 1
In the folder `Documents/INFO111/Project1` you will find the starter code the professor had you download. Open the project in Atom.

## Task 2
For INFO 1111, the professor gave you an example from last year's class to use as reference. You can find it in `Documents/INFO1111/Example17`. Open up the project in Atom.

## Task 3
You, an ever diligent student, decide to go to office hours to discuss with your TA your new code. However, he has a small screen that he works off of, and wants you to make no line longer than 80. As a regular user of Atom, you know that you don't have to sit and hit `enter` at every line, and that you can change the Atom preferred line length setting. Make your TA happy and have no line be longer than 70 characters

## Task 4
You've just cloned your assignment and are beginning to work on it. You decide you will start up a php-server with the starter code. Note: In the beginning of the semester, the professor had all his students download the `Whitespace` and `php server` packages. However, you never did.
