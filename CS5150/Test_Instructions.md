## Instructions

### Before The Student Gets There
1. Start up two computers, one for you, one for the testee. Start an [appear.in](https://appear.in/) between the two computers. Get it set up by:
 * Click `Share Screen`
 * Click Application Window
 * Click Atom (note Atom must already be open on the sharing computer)
 * **DO NOT** start the screen sharing yet

1. On your computer, open up QuickTime player from LaunchPad (we all have macs), click File, then start new screen recording

1. On the testee's computer, open up the `StudentUseCaseGuide.pdf` that is in our github repo.

2. Make sure Atom Beta is installed with our package and is good to go on the testee's computer

3. Copy the `INFO1111` folder into your Documents

3. Make sure the `Php Server` package is installed. You can do this by doing "`Cmd+Shift+P -> Settings View: Open -> Install`"

4. In your atom settings "`Cmd+Shift+P -> Settings View: Editor`", turn on Soft Wrap and softWrapAtPreferredLineLength

5. In a new window of atom, open your entire documents folder, then close that `File -> Close Window`. This will make it so when the testee starts it up, they will start in your documents folder

6. Make sure that the config files are set to have all the line default stuff at 90 and packages reset to their original configuration. Easiest way is to copy from the git repository.


### When the student gets there
1. Read them the script below:

Thank you for participating in user testing for a new plugin to the Atom Text Editor; Today, you will be presented with a variety of tasks. **The focus of these tasks will be on the plugin itself, not on you as a user**. You are free to quit at any time.

This test will take approximately 30 minutes. All personal data will be kept confidential, reviewed only by the our team and the CS 5150 course staff.  The results of your test will be written up in a report with all personally identifiable data removed.

Over the course of the test, your screen interaction will be recorded using screen capture. Moreover, the administrative team will be personally observing and noting your interaction with the program. Again, the focus of our notes will be on the program, not you as the user.

You will be presented with a [guide](https://github.com/Saqif280/atomic-management#readme) on how to work with this particular package, but this will be the only guidance the you will have regarding the user testing. If you are truly stuck on a particular aspect, you may skip it; however, we will not be able to answer any questions you have while the test is being conducted. At the end of the test, we will ask you some questions regarding your experience with the package.

If you have any questions regarding the use of the results of the user testing, feel free to contact the development team liaison, Daniel Hirsch, at djh329@cornell.edu. We thank you for your participation.

2. Now **start** the screen sharing from the tester's computer.

2. Remind them to think out loud as they are working.

2. Give them the pdf of the user test that you opened before they got There

2. Let them go

### After they complete the tasks

1. Shut the screen sharing and stop the screen recording. Explain the goal of our package in a bit more detail. At that point, now ask the following questions and record their responses. You should put their name and test date on wherever you log their responses:

 * On a scale of 1-5, one being not intuitive at all, 5 being highly intuitive, how would you evaluate our package?
 * Following on the last question, please explain your response. Please highlight any areas where you were confused or where you
thought the system was effective.
 * Who do you see as potential users of this program?
 * On a scale of 1-5, 1 being uncomfortable and 5 being very comfortable, how comfortable are you with others configuring your atom workspace? Would it depend if the person configuring your workspace was a teacher, employer or other superior?


 2. Thank them for their time
 3. Clean up the room
